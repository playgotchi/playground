# Welcome to the Playground
**[Playground by Playgotchi](https://playground.playgotchi.com) is where onchain communities play together.**

We make it easy and fun for people to participate in multiplayer mode by fostering connection and collaboration. We bring people into playgrounds (collaborative canvases) to explore their imagination, create together, mint their co-creations, and share [**Zora**](https://zora.co) [protocol rewards](https://support.zora.co/en/articles/1368641) on [**Base**](https://base.org).
